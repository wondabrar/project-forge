// Travel mode — the session you can train away from your gym.
//
// The OLD travel mode was a filter inside the swap sheet: per-exercise,
// per-session, reset every time the sheet opened, and it offered NOTHING for
// the main lifts (a heavy-equivalents-only swap list has no bodyweight member,
// so every session's anchor read "no alternatives"). Boss verdict: "does fuck
// all." This replaces it.
//
// THE CLAIM travel mode makes: you are away from the gym and still training.
// It is NOT a rest state — lib/breaks.js already owns that, and its
// "Travelling" reason means resting away. Keep the two apart in copy.
//
// WHAT IT DOES: takes the session the engine already resolved — rotation,
// swaps and focus applied — and converts each slot to a movement that trains
// the same muscles with the assumed kit. The A/B/C shape survives: same
// blocks, same slots, same order, reps translated up because bodyweight
// stimulus arrives later in a set.
//
// ASSUMED KIT (boss ruling, 2026-08-04): a pull-up bar and a block/step are
// assumed. Household items count as kit — a backpack is the travel barbell,
// a towel is both slider and anchor, a table edge is a row, bottles are
// light isolation, a sofa is a bench.
//
// WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOESN'T DO: feed the progression engine. A travel
// session's loads say nothing about what your barbell prescription should be,
// so the record carries `travel: true` and the engine skips it. Volume still
// counts in the Lab, and the day still ticks — that is the entire point.
